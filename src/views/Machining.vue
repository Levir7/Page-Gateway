        <h2>CNC MACHINING</h2>
        <p>Gateway Fabrication Solutions machining operation has experienced an important growth over the years due to an intensive investment strategy with late model equipment. Our vertical and horizontal machining capabilities include new CNC Multi-Slide Automatics Lathes, 7 Axis Turning Centers, Dual Spindle Gantry Lathe with Robotic Arms, Centerless Grinders, Swiss Type Lathes and more conventional Live Tooling Horizontal Lathes and magazine bar feeders. Our processes continuously move toward shorter cycle times, tighter tolerances and faster LT. It is our customer focus that enables us to design a robust machining process through our CAM software solutions and experienced CNC Technicians. For lower volume jobs, our extensive line of 15 Horizontal and Vertical Machining Centers will prove to be a competitive proposal, while our 17 automatic multi-spindles will handle any high-volume challenge.
