        <h2>PLATING</h2>
        <p>Gateway Fabrication Solutions' pursuit to exceed our customers' expectations led us to in-source our plating for a more controlled process and shorter LT. Our plating capabilities continue to expand from our initial environmentally friendly trivalent zinc plating (Alkaline and Acid) and semi-bright / bright nickel plating to other services, such as electroless, stainless steel passivation, and trivalent chrome plating processes. We pride ourselves on carefully maintaining the purity of our plating chemistries to maintain the highest levels of quality. Experienced chemical engineers through our chemical lab analyze our baths multiple times per day to ensure proper chemistry and continuously filter them to remove drag-in residues. Contaminants are being filtered incessantly and monitored through our SPC System.
